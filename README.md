# webpack-boilerplate

##Hello Work & Co!
Here's a small shopping application.
Built using Webpack, SCSS, ES6, and Angular JS

##To Get Up and Running
Head to root, and run 
`npm install`
Next you should be able to run a local instance easily 
`npm run webpack`
This will create a local instance, with the script in the memory. My index is set to run off of it, but can be switched out, in the tags by changing to:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/build/bundle.js"></script>
```
##url
`http://localhost:8080/index.html`
