# webpack-boilerplate

##Hello Work & Co!
Here's a small shopping application.
Built using Webpack, SCSS, ES6, and Angular JS

##To Get Up and Running
Head to root, and run

```
npm install
```

Next you should be able to run a local instance now by typing:
```
npm run webpack

```
This will create a local instance, with the script in memory (the joy of webpack). My index is set to run off of it, but can be switched out to the physical copy, by the tags by changing the tags in the `index.html`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/build/bundle.js"></script>
```
##url
`http://localhost:8080/index.html`
